# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - ClickHouse Cloud Integration

## TL;DR

You need **one piece of information** before you can run the demo with your ClickHouse Cloud logs:

**Your ClickHouse Cloud Host** (e.g., `abc123.us-east-1.aws.clickhouse.cloud`)

---

## 3-Minute Setup

### 0. Test It First! 🧪

**You can test RIGHT NOW without any configuration:**

```bash
python test_clickhouse_integration.py
```

This validates everything works. Expected: 7/8 tests pass (mock mode).

---

### 1. Get Your ClickHouse Host 🔍

Find it in your [ClickHouse Cloud Console](https://clickhouse.cloud/) under "Connection Details"

### 2. Set It 🔧

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_HOST='your-instance.clickhouse.cloud'
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_HOST='your-instance.clickhouse.cloud'
```

### 3. Discover Your Tables 🔎

```bash
python discover_clickhouse_tables.py
```

This shows all your tables and their structure.

### 4. Set Your Table Name 📊

```powershell
# Windows
$env:CLICKHOUSE_TABLE_NAME='your_table_name'
```

```bash
# Linux/Mac
export CLICKHOUSE_TABLE_NAME='your_table_name'
```

### 5. Run the Demo! 🎉

```bash
python demo_real_data_pipeline.py
```

That's it! The demo will fetch your real logs and show autonomous remediation in action.

## What Changed?

✅ **Before**: Demo used dummy CSV data  
✅ **Now**: Demo fetches real logs from your ClickHouse Cloud

✅ **Your credentials are already configured** (key: `kRuHI0HdODEAJokHcaTy`)  
✅ **Just need to tell it where your ClickHouse instance is**

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Not connected to ClickHouse Cloud"
→ Set `CLICKHOUSE_CLOUD_HOST` (see step 2 above)

### ❌ "Could not fetch tables"
→ Check your hostname is correct (no `https://` or ports)

### ❌ "No logs found"
→ Run discovery script to find the right table name

## What the Demo Does

1. **Connects** to your ClickHouse Cloud
2. **Fetches** real logs from your table
3. **Processes** them through the AI agent pipeline
4. **Simulates** a schema drift incident
5. **Demonstrates** autonomous detection and remediation
6. **Shows** the system learning from the incident

**Zero human intervention required!** ⚡
